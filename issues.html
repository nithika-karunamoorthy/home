			<h1>Issues in Classrooms</h1>
			<p>Technology can be helpful in classrooms, while it can be a distraction. Students are able to use their phones in class for non-educational purposes which causing their grades to go down. Students are also caught cheating with devices in the classroom which defeats the purpose of learning. Also it can interfere with the students privacy. Moreover, with all those technology there can be tons network overload with all those students using the network. This also cause people to have low attendance and increasing multitasking.</p>
