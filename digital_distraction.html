	  <h1 style="font-size:3vw;">Impacts</h1>
	  <p>There are many impacts that digital distraction can cause to the environment and to society. For society, it can cause people to make the gap between the rich and the poor greater that it would be harder for the poor to feed their families and the rich to keep up their status. For environmental, there are many problems with devices ending up in the trash and in our oceans. What happens to your old phone or laptop when you get a new one, and how does the increasing amount of technotrash impact the environment? Who makes all of your technological devices, and what kind of working conditions do they have? How does it affect opportunities when there's a divide between those with access to technology and those without? These are just some of the questions that are raised by our use of technology. These are some impacts of digital distraction.
